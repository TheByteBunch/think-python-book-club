# Session Zero

This session was held in The Byte Bunch's Discord Server on 2023-08-06 and simulcast on YouTube and Twitch. You may watch the YouTube replay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH0wq2v4iEA). Erik discussed why he chose this book, and how he plans to run the book club.

Here are Erik's notes from the session:
